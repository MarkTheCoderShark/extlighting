      {/* Introduction */}
      <p>
        You&apos;ve been looking at permanent outdoor lighting for a while now.
        You&apos;ve read the{" "}
        <Link href="/blog/permanent-outdoor-lights-cost-sacramento">
          cost breakdowns
        </Link>
        , you&apos;ve browsed photos, and you&apos;re pretty sure this is the
        right move for your home. But there&apos;s one question that keeps
        coming up: &quot;What are they actually going to do to my house?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s a completely fair question. Most Sacramento homeowners have
        never had something like this installed before. It&apos;s not like
        getting a new furnace or replacing a water heater, where you have some
        general idea of what the process looks like. Permanent outdoor lighting
        is unfamiliar territory for most people, and the unknown creates
        anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let&apos;s walk through the entire process, start to finish. Every
        step, every detail, exactly what happens and when. By the end of this
        guide, you&apos;ll know precisely what to expect if you decide to move
        forward, and there won&apos;t be any surprises along the way.
      </p>

      {/* Step 1: Consultation */}
      <h2>Step 1 &ndash; The Free Consultation and Property Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Everything starts with a phone call or a{" "}
        <Link href="/quote">quote request through our website</Link>. We&apos;ll
        schedule a time that works for you, and one of our lighting specialists
        will come out to your home. This is a no-cost, no-obligation visit.
        Nobody is going to pressure you into signing anything on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the consultation, here&apos;s what actually happens:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Roofline measurement:</strong> We walk the perimeter of your
          home and measure every section of roofline, soffit, and fascia that
          could potentially receive lighting. We note the linear footage, the
          number of peaks and valleys, and any architectural features that
          affect the layout.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Goal discussion:</strong> We ask you what you&apos;re looking
          for. Do you want full-perimeter lighting or just the front-facing
          roofline? Are you mainly interested in holiday color displays, or do
          you want warm white accent lighting year-round? Are there specific
          features of your home you want to highlight, like a stone facade,
          columns, or a dramatic entryway?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mounting point identification:</strong> We examine the fascia
          board, soffit, and trim to determine the best mounting surface for
          your home. Most Sacramento homes have wood fascia or stucco, and we
          note which attachment method will work best for your specific
          construction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Electrical access check:</strong> We locate your existing
          outdoor outlets and electrical panel to plan where the
          transformer/controller will be installed. In most cases, we can use
          an existing outdoor outlet. If your home doesn&apos;t have one in a
          convenient location, we&apos;ll discuss options.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Color and feature walkthrough:</strong> We&apos;ll show you
          what the system can do. Millions of colors, scheduling capabilities,
          app control, preset holiday themes, and custom scenes. This is
          usually the part where homeowners start getting excited instead of
          anxious.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The whole consultation takes about 30 to 45 minutes. Some homeowners
        want to walk every inch of the house with us; others just want the key
        details. We work at your pace. Before we leave, you&apos;ll have a
        clear idea of what the project would look like, and we&apos;ll have
        everything we need to create your custom proposal.
      </p>

      {/* Step 2: Design and Proposal */}
      <h2>Step 2 &ndash; Custom Design and Proposal</h2>
      <p>
        After the on-site assessment, we go back to the office and put your
        custom lighting plan together. This isn&apos;t a generic template we
        slap your address on. It&apos;s a plan designed specifically for your
        home&apos;s roofline, architecture, and your stated goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your proposal includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Total linear footage:</strong> The exact measurement of
          lighting track your system will require.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recommended zones:</strong> We&apos;ll suggest how to divide
          your lighting into controllable zones. A typical residential system
          has 1 to 3 zones. For example, the front roofline might be one zone,
          the garage and side entry another, and accent sections a third. Zones
          let you run different colors or brightness levels on different parts
          of your home simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Color capabilities review:</strong> A summary of what the
          system can do, including RGBW (red, green, blue, white) mixing,
          warm white and cool white settings, preset holiday themes, and app
          features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exact pricing with no hidden fees:</strong> The number on
          your proposal is the number you pay. Materials, labor, controller,
          app setup, cleanup, warranty &ndash; everything is included. There
          are no surprise charges on installation day. No &quot;oh, we found
          something unexpected, that&apos;ll be another $500.&quot; The price
          is the price.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We typically deliver your proposal within 2 to 3 business days of the
        consultation. You can review it at your own pace, ask questions, request
        adjustments (maybe you want to add the back patio section, or you
        decide to skip one side of the house to bring the cost down). There is
        no expiration date and no high-pressure deadline. When you&apos;re ready
        to move forward, just let us know and we&apos;ll get you on the
        schedule.
      </p>

      {/* Step 3: Installation Day */}
      <h2>Step 3 &ndash; Installation Day</h2>
      <p>
        This is the main event, and it&apos;s the part most homeowners are most
        curious (and most nervous) about. Here&apos;s how the day unfolds.
      </p>

      <h3>What to Expect That Morning</h3>
      <p>
        Our crew arrives at the scheduled time, typically in the morning to
        maximize daylight working hours. They&apos;ll introduce themselves,
        review the installation plan with you briefly, and walk the property to
        confirm the layout. Then they set up their equipment: ladders, safety
        gear, and tools. If you have landscaping, patio furniture, or anything
        near the work area, the crew will move carefully around it. We treat
        your property the way we&apos;d treat our own.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don&apos;t need to do anything special to prepare. We don&apos;t
        need access inside your home (unless your electrical panel is in the
        garage, in which case we&apos;ll need the garage open). You don&apos;t
        need to move your cars unless they&apos;re parked directly beneath a
        section of roofline we&apos;re working on. Most homeowners go about
        their normal day while we work.
      </p>

      <h3>How the Lights Are Mounted</h3>
      <p>
        The lighting system uses a professional-grade aluminum track (also
        called a channel) that mounts directly to your fascia board or soffit.
        Think of it as a slim, low-profile rail that holds the individual LED
        modules in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s how the mounting works:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The aluminum channel is cut to match each section of your roofline.
          Corners, peaks, and valleys are mitered for a clean, custom fit.
        </li>
        <li>
          The channel attaches to your fascia board using screws. The screws go
          into the fascia &ndash; <strong>not into your roof decking, not
          into your shingles, and not into your gutters</strong>. This is
          important: the mounting does not penetrate your roof in any way.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the channel is secured, the LED light modules snap into place
          inside the track. They sit flush, creating a clean line of light
          along your roofline.
        </li>
        <li>
          The finished installation is remarkably low-profile. The channels are
          typically painted or powder-coated to match your trim color. During
          the day, from the street, they&apos;re virtually invisible.
          Neighbors and visitors will notice your lights at night, but during
          the day, most people cannot tell the system is there at all.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Wiring and Electrical</h3>
      <p>
        Permanent outdoor lighting systems run on low-voltage LED technology.
        This is not a high-voltage electrical project. Here&apos;s how the
        electrical side works:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A transformer/controller unit is mounted near an existing outdoor
          electrical outlet, usually on the side of the house or in the garage.
          This is the brain of the system. It converts your standard household
          power to the low-voltage output the LEDs require.
        </li>
        <li>
          Low-voltage wiring runs from the controller up to the light channels.
          The wiring is routed cleanly along existing trim lines, behind
          downspouts, or through other concealed pathways. We don&apos;t leave
          wires draped across your siding or dangling from eaves.
        </li>
        <li>
          All connections are sealed with professional-grade weatherproof
          connectors. Sacramento&apos;s rainy season from November through
          March can deliver intense, driving rain, and every junction in your
          system is built to handle it.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the vast majority of installations, no electrical permit is
          required and no modifications to your home&apos;s electrical panel
          are needed. The system plugs into an existing outdoor outlet. If your
          home needs an outlet added, we&apos;ll discuss that during the
          consultation and include it in the quote.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How Long Does It Take?</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most common questions we get. Here&apos;s what to expect
        based on your home&apos;s size and complexity:
      </p>

      <p>
        Most residential installations are completed in a single day. That
        surprises a lot of homeowners. You go to work in the morning with a
        bare roofline and come home to a fully installed, fully functional
        permanent lighting system. The ranch-style homes common in Citrus
        Heights, Rancho Cordova, and parts of Fair Oaks are often done by
        early afternoon. Larger two-story homes in Roseville, Folsom, and
        Rocklin typically wrap up by late afternoon. Even the bigger custom
        homes in El Dorado Hills and Loomis are usually a single-day job.
      </p>
      <p>
        For{" "}
        <Link href="/services/commercial">commercial properties</Link>,
        timelines depend on the building size and scope. A small retail
        storefront might be half a day. A large restaurant, office building, or
        multi-structure property can take 1 to 3 days. We schedule commercial
        work to minimize disruption to your business operations.
      </p>

      <h3>What About My Roof and Gutters?</h3>
      <p>
        This is the concern we hear most often, and it&apos;s worth addressing
        directly. Homeowners worry that mounting a lighting system will damage
        their roof, void their roof warranty, or interfere with their gutters.
        Here are the facts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No drilling into your roof:</strong> The mounting channel
          attaches to the fascia board (the vertical board behind your gutter)
          or the soffit (the underside of the roof overhang). We do not drill
          into roof decking, shingles, tiles, or any part of the waterproof
          roof membrane.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Roof warranty remains intact:</strong> Because the system
          does not penetrate the roof surface, it does not affect your roofing
          warranty. The fascia board is part of the trim, not the roofing
          system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gutters are not modified:</strong> The lighting channel
          mounts above or behind the gutter line. We don&apos;t attach
          anything to the gutters themselves, drill through them, or impede
          water flow. Your gutter system continues to function exactly as it
          did before.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean, damage-free installation:</strong> Our crew takes care
          to protect your home during the install. If a screw hole is ever
          needed in fascia, it&apos;s sealed with exterior-grade sealant.
          There are no rough edges, no splintered wood, no cosmetic damage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      {/* Step 4: Setup and Testing */}
      <h2>Step 4 &ndash; Setup, Testing, and Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>
        Once the physical installation is complete, the crew doesn&apos;t just
        pack up and leave. This next phase is just as important as the mounting
        itself.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Controller programming:</strong> The transformer/controller
          is powered on and configured. Each lighting zone is mapped and tested
          to confirm every section responds correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>App setup:</strong> We help you download the lighting control
          app on your phone and connect it to your system. We set up your Wi-Fi
          connection and verify that you can control the lights from your
          device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Feature walkthrough:</strong> This is the fun part. We walk
          you through everything the system can do: how to change colors, how
          to set automated schedules (lights on at sunset, off at midnight),
          how to save your favorite color scenes, how to activate preset
          holiday themes, and how to adjust brightness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Zone testing:</strong> We cycle through each zone
          individually and then all zones together. You&apos;ll see every color,
          every transition, and every effect. If anything looks off &ndash; a
          section that&apos;s slightly dimmer, a color that doesn&apos;t match
          &ndash; we address it on the spot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your questions, answered:</strong> We stay until you&apos;re
          comfortable. Some homeowners pick it up in five minutes. Others want
          to spend 20 minutes exploring the app and trying different looks.
          There&apos;s no rush. We want you to feel confident using your new
          system the moment we leave.
        </li>
      </ul>

      {/* Step 5: Cleanup */}
      <h2>Step 5 &ndash; Cleanup and Final Inspection</h2>
      <p>
        Before we consider the job done, our crew does a complete cleanup of
        your property. That means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All packaging materials, wire scraps, and installation debris are
          collected and removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any landscaping or features that were moved or adjusted during the
          install are returned to their original position.
        </li>
        <li>
          The work area is swept or blown clean. No sawdust on your driveway,
          no screw casings in your flower beds.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do a final walkthrough with you to point out the controller
          location, show the wire routing, and confirm you&apos;re happy with
          the overall appearance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We have a simple standard: leave the property cleaner than we found it.
        Our crews take that seriously. You shouldn&apos;t find a single piece
        of evidence that we were there, other than the beautiful lighting
        system on your roofline.
      </p>

      {/* After Installation */}
      <h2>After Installation: What to Know</h2>
      <p>
        Your system is installed, your app is set up, and your home looks
        incredible. Here&apos;s what life looks like from this point forward.
      </p>

      <h3>The App</h3>
      <p>
        Your smartphone is now your remote control. Change colors from the
        couch, set schedules while you&apos;re at work, or switch to a holiday
        theme from the grocery store parking lot. The app stores your saved
        scenes, so once you create a look you love, it&apos;s one tap to
        activate it any time. Most homeowners set a daily schedule (warm white
        at sunset, off at midnight) and then manually switch to holiday themes
        or special colors when the occasion calls for it.
      </p>

      <h3>Scheduling</h3>
      <p>
        The scheduling feature is one of the most appreciated parts of the
        system. You can set your lights to turn on and off automatically based
        on time of day or sunset/sunrise. Once it&apos;s programmed, you
        don&apos;t have to think about it again. Your home is lit every night,
        even when you&apos;re on vacation. That consistent, automatic exterior
        lighting is a genuine security benefit &ndash; a dark house tells
        people nobody is home, while a well-lit house says the opposite.

      <h3>Warranty Coverage</h3>
      <p>
        EXT Lighting backs every installation with a{" "}
        <strong>lifetime warranty on parts and labor</strong>. That means if an
        LED module stops working in 3 years, we replace it at no cost. If a
        wiring connection fails in 10 years, we fix it at no cost. If the
        controller needs service in 7 years, that&apos;s covered too. Parts
        and labor, for as long as you own the system. No fine print that
        excludes weather-related wear. No deductibles. No service call fees.

      <h3>Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        Permanent outdoor lights require virtually zero maintenance. There are
        no bulbs to replace, no strings to untangle, no ladders to climb.
        The only thing we recommend is an occasional rinse with a garden hose
        once or twice a year to clear off accumulated dust and pollen. Living
        in the Sacramento Valley, you know what spring pollen does to every
        outdoor surface. A quick rinse in April after pollen season and
        another before the holidays in October keeps your lights looking their
        absolute best.

      {/* Common Questions */}
      <h2>Common Questions About the Installation Process</h2>
      <p>
        We hear these questions from nearly every homeowner we work with.
        Here are straightforward answers.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I Need to Be Home During Installation?</h3>
      <p>
        Not necessarily. As long as we have access to the exterior of your home
        and the electrical outlet or garage where the controller will be
        mounted, you don&apos;t need to be present for the installation itself.
        However, we strongly recommend being home for the final walkthrough and
        app setup at the end. That usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes and
        ensures you know how to use every feature of your new system.
      </p>

      <h3>Will the Installation Damage My Roof or Gutters?</h3>
      <p>
        No. The mounting channel attaches to the fascia board or soffit, not the
        roof surface. We do not drill into shingles, tiles, or roof decking.
        Gutters are not modified or drilled. Your roof warranty is unaffected.
        This is one of the most common concerns we address, and it&apos;s the
        one we can answer most definitively: the installation does not damage
        your roof.
      </p>

      <h3>What if It Rains on Installation Day?</h3>
      <p>
        Sacramento&apos;s dry summers mean rain is rarely an issue from May
        through October, which is our busiest season. During the winter months,
        if rain is in the forecast, we&apos;ll proactively reschedule to a dry
        day. Installing in active rain isn&apos;t safe for the crew and
        doesn&apos;t produce the best results for sealing connections. If we
        need to reschedule, we&apos;ll contact you in advance and find the next
        available dry day. It&apos;s never more than a short delay.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I Need Any Electrical Work Done First?</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases, no. The system plugs into a standard outdoor electrical
        outlet. The majority of Sacramento homes built in the last 40 years
        have at least one outdoor outlet that works for our purposes. If your
        home doesn&apos;t have a conveniently located outdoor outlet (common
        with some older homes in East Sacramento, Land Park, or Curtis Park),
        we can coordinate having one added. We&apos;ll identify this during
        the consultation so there are no surprises.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I Add More Lights Later?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely. Many homeowners start with the front roofline and add the
        sides or back of the house later. The system is designed to be
        expandable. When you&apos;re ready to add on, we come back, extend the
        track, add the additional LED modules, and integrate the new sections
        into your existing controller. It&apos;s a straightforward process.
      </p>

      <h3>What Happens if Something Breaks After Installation?</h3>
      <p>
        You call us. Our lifetime warranty on parts and labor means we come out
        and fix it at no charge. Whether it&apos;s a section of LEDs that
        stopped responding, a controller glitch, or a wiring issue, you&apos;re
        covered. No diagnostic fees, no service call charges. We stand behind
        our work for as long as you own the system. You can also find more

      {/* What Sacramento Homeowners Wish They Knew */}
      <h2>What Sacramento Homeowners Wish They Knew Before Installation</h2>
      <p>
        After hundreds of installations across the Sacramento metro area, we
        hear the same comments over and over. Here&apos;s what homeowners
        consistently tell us they wish they had known going in.
      </p>

      <h3>It&apos;s Faster Than You Think</h3>
      <p>
        Almost every homeowner is surprised by how quickly the installation
        goes. People expect a multi-day project with scaffolding and
        disruption. Instead, a crew shows up in the morning, and by afternoon,
        you have a fully functional permanent lighting system. A family in
        Roseville told us they left for work expecting to come home to a
        half-finished project and instead found the crew doing the final
        cleanup. That&apos;s a typical experience.
      </p>

      <h3>The Channels Are Truly Invisible During the Day</h3>
      <p>
        This is the one that surprises people the most. Homeowners worry that
        mounting hardware on their roofline will look bulky or obvious. Then the
        install happens, and they walk to the street, look up, and genuinely
        cannot see the channels. The slim aluminum profile, color-matched to
        your trim, disappears into the roofline. Homeowners in El Dorado Hills
        and Folsom, where curb appeal standards are particularly high, are
        consistently relieved at how seamless it looks.
      </p>

      <h3>The First Night Is Something Special</h3>
      <p>
        We&apos;re not going to pretend this is some life-changing event. But
        honestly? The first night you pull into your driveway and see your home
        glowing with perfectly even, beautiful light along every roofline, it
        hits differently than you expect. Homeowners tell us they sit in their
        car for a minute just looking at their house. They call family members
        to come outside and see it. They take photos and send them to everyone
        they know. It&apos;s a genuinely satisfying moment, and after the
        research, the decision-making, and the investment, you deserve to enjoy
        it.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Neighbors Will Ask About It</h3>
      <p>
        This one is guaranteed. Within the first week, at least one neighbor
        will knock on your door or stop you in the driveway to ask about your
        lights. It happens in every neighborhood we serve, from Orangevale to
        Auburn to Rocklin. In many subdivisions across Roseville and Rancho
        Cordova, one installation leads to three or four more on the same
        street within a few months. There&apos;s a genuine neighborhood effect
        that we see repeated across Sacramento, Placer, El Dorado, and Nevada
        counties.
      </p>

      <h3>You&apos;ll Use Them More Than You Expected</h3>
      <p>
        Most people go into the purchase thinking about Christmas lights. And
        yes, the holiday season is incredible with permanent LEDs. But what
        catches homeowners off guard is how much they use the lights the rest
        of the year. Warm white every night as accent lighting. Sacramento
        Kings purple and gray during the playoffs. Red, white, and blue for
        the Fourth of July. Orange and purple for Halloween. School colors for
        homecoming. Teal for a gender reveal. Pink for a birthday party. Once
        the lights are there, you find reasons to use them constantly.
