      {/* Introduction */}
      <p>
        If you&apos;re considering permanent outdoor lights for your Sacramento
        home, the first question on your mind is almost certainly: &quot;How
        much is this going to cost?&quot; It&apos;s the right question to ask,
        and you deserve a real answer, not a vague &quot;it depends.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is that permanent outdoor lighting costs in Sacramento
        typically range from <strong>$3,000 to $6,000</strong> for most
        residential homes. That&apos;s a wide range, and where you land depends
        on factors like the size of your home, the complexity of your roofline,
        and how many sides of the house you want lit up. We&apos;ll break all of
        that down in this guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Sacramento-based permanent lighting company, we&apos;ve installed
        systems on everything from 1,200 sq ft ranch homes in Citrus Heights to
        5,000+ sq ft custom builds in El Dorado Hills. We&apos;ve also outfitted
        restaurants, office buildings, and retail storefronts across the metro
        area. The pricing in this guide reflects what Sacramento homeowners and
        business owners are actually paying in 2026, not national averages pulled
        from a database somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you&apos;re looking at permanent Christmas lights that double as
        year-round accent lighting, or you want a full exterior LED lighting
        system with app control and custom color scenes, this guide will give you
        the numbers you need to make an informed decision.

      <p>
        <strong>Single-story ranch homes ($2,500 to $4,000):</strong> This
        covers most of the classic ranch-style homes you see throughout
        Sacramento, Rancho Cordova, and Citrus Heights. These homes have simpler
        rooflines with fewer peaks, and the single-story height keeps
        installation straightforward. Most homeowners in this category light the
        front roofline and one or both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Two-story homes ($3,500 to $5,500):</strong> Common throughout
        Roseville, Rocklin, and Folsom, two-story homes have more linear footage
        and the added height requires specialized equipment. If your two-story
        has multiple gables or a complex front elevation, expect to be toward the
        higher end of this range.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Large and custom homes ($5,000 to $8,000+):</strong> The custom
        homes in El Dorado Hills, Granite Bay, and parts of Fair Oaks often have
        extensive rooflines with multiple peaks, dormers, and varied elevations.
        These properties look incredible when fully lit, but the additional
        footage and complexity push the price higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Commercial properties ($5,000 to $25,000+):</strong> Commercial
        pricing depends heavily on the building size and the owner&apos;s goals.
        A small retail storefront might come in around $5,000, while a large
        restaurant or office complex with full perimeter lighting can exceed
        $20,000. Learn more about our{" "}

      </p>

      {/* Factors Affecting Price */}
      <h2>What Factors Affect Your Permanent Lighting Price?</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding what drives the cost helps you make smarter decisions about
        your project. Here are the factors that matter most.
      </p>

      <h3>Linear Footage of Roofline (The Primary Cost Driver)</h3>
      <p>
        This is the single biggest factor in your permanent outdoor lights cost.
        The industry standard runs <strong>$20 to $40 per linear foot</strong>,
        installed. That includes the LED lights, mounting channel, wiring, and
        labor. A home with 150 feet of roofline will naturally cost more than one
        with 100 feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s a useful exercise: walk the perimeter of your home and
        estimate the roofline you want to light. Most people start with the front
        of the house and the sides visible from the street. You don&apos;t have
        to light every inch. Many Sacramento homeowners choose to light the front
        and side rooflines, skipping the back of the house entirely, which can
        save 25% to 35% of the total cost.
      </p>

      <h3>Roofline Complexity</h3>
      <p>
        A straight roofline is faster and easier to install than one with
        multiple valleys, dormers, or mixed elevations. Each peak, valley, and
        corner requires additional channel cutting, wiring connections, and
        installation time. If your home has a hip roof with four sloping sides,
        expect a bit more complexity (and cost) compared to a simple gable roof
        with two straight runs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the newer communities in Roseville and Rocklin feature homes with
        decorative rooflines, multiple front gables, and stone accents that add
        visual interest but also add installation time. That said, these homes
        look absolutely stunning with permanent lighting, and the extra cost is
        usually modest ($200 to $500 more than a similar-sized home with a
        simpler roofline).
      </p>

      <h3>Number of Lighting Zones</h3>
      <p>
        Lighting zones let you control different sections of your home
        independently. Want the front of the house in warm white while the back
        patio area glows blue? That requires separate zones. Most residential
        installations include 1 to 3 zones. Additional zones add $150 to $300
        each, depending on the wiring complexity. For most homes, 2 zones (front
        and back/sides) offer the best balance of flexibility and cost.
      </p>

      <h3>Controller and App Features</h3>
      <p>
        Every system we install comes with a controller and smartphone app that
        lets you change colors, set schedules, and create custom lighting scenes.
        The base controller is included in all our pricing. Premium controller
        upgrades with features like music sync, motion activation, or integration
        with smart home systems (Alexa, Google Home) are available as add-ons.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        The height of your roofline and what&apos;s below it affects
        installation time. A single-story home with a flat driveway below is the
        easiest scenario. A two-story home with mature trees, sloped landscaping,
        or a pool fence below the roofline takes more time and specialized
        equipment. Steep roof pitches (common in some of the Tudor and
        Craftsman-style homes around Orangevale and Fair Oaks) can also add to
        the labor.
      </p>

      <h3>Sacramento-Specific: Stucco vs. Wood Trim</h3>
      <p>
        This is a detail that most national pricing guides miss. A huge
        percentage of Sacramento-area homes have stucco exteriors. Mounting
        permanent lights on stucco requires different hardware and techniques
        than mounting on wood trim or fascia board. Stucco attachment is
        completely doable (we do it every day), but it takes a bit more care to
        ensure a clean, weatherproof installation. If your home has wood fascia
        or trim along the roofline, mounting is slightly simpler. If
        it&apos;s all stucco, expect no price difference from us, as we account
        for stucco work in our standard pricing for the Sacramento area.
      </p>

      </p>

      {/* Permanent vs Temporary */}
      <h2>Permanent Lights vs. Temporary: The Real Cost Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        Many Sacramento homeowners start by comparing permanent outdoor lights to
        the cost of hiring someone to hang temporary Christmas lights each year.
        Let&apos;s look at the actual numbers.
      </p>

      <h3>The Annual Cost of Temporary Lights</h3>
      <p>
        Professional temporary light installation in the Sacramento area runs{" "}
        <strong>$300 to $600 per year</strong> for a typical home. That covers
        installation in November, takedown in January, and basic string lights.
        If you want higher-quality LEDs or more elaborate displays, you could
        spend $800 or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here&apos;s how that adds up over time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>5 years:</strong> $1,500 to $3,000 spent on temporary lights
          (and you own nothing permanent afterward)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>10 years:</strong> $3,000 to $6,000, which is right in the
          range of a permanent system that lasts 15 to 20 years
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>15 years:</strong> $4,500 to $9,000 on temporary installs
          alone
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After 10 years of paying for temporary installation, you&apos;ve spent
        enough to have bought a permanent system, and you have nothing to show
        for it. No lights on the house, no year-round accent lighting, nothing.
      </p>

      <h3>What Temporary Lights Can&apos;t Do</h3>
      <p>
        Cost is only part of the comparison. Temporary lights come with
        limitations that permanent systems simply don&apos;t have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Safety risks:</strong> Someone has to climb a ladder to put
          them up and take them down. Falls from ladders send thousands of people
          to the ER every holiday season. With permanent lights, nobody climbs a
          ladder after the initial professional installation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited use:</strong> Temporary lights go up for 6 to 8 weeks
          and come down. Permanent lights work 365 days a year. Set them to warm
          white for everyday elegance, switch to red and green for Christmas,
          orange for Halloween, red, white, and blue for the Fourth of July, or
          your team&apos;s colors for game day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Degrading quality:</strong> String lights fade, break, and
          tangle. You end up replacing them every 2 to 3 years even if you
          install them yourself. Permanent LED systems maintain their brightness
          and color quality for 15 to 20 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage hassle:</strong> Sacramento garages are already full.
          Nobody wants bins of tangled lights taking up space for 10 months of
          the year.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Monthly Operating Cost</h3>
      <p>
        One concern we hear is the electricity cost of running permanent lights.
        Here&apos;s the reality: modern LED permanent lighting systems are
        extremely efficient. Running a typical residential system through SMUD
        (Sacramento Municipal Utility District) costs approximately{" "}
        <strong>$3 to $8 per month</strong>, depending on how many hours per day
        you run them and how many linear feet you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        SMUD&apos;s residential rates are among the lowest in California, which
        makes Sacramento one of the more affordable places to operate permanent
        outdoor lighting. Most homeowners set their lights on a timer, running
        them from dusk to 11 PM or midnight. At those hours, the monthly cost is
        closer to $3 to $5.

      {/* Financing */}
      <h2>Financing Options</h2>

      <h2>Bottom Line: What Should You Budget?</h2>
      <p>
        For most Sacramento homes, budget <strong>$3,000 to $6,000</strong> for a
        complete permanent outdoor lighting system with professional
