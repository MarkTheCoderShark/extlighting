## FAQ Content

### Pricing FAQs

**Q: How much does permanent lighting cost?**
"Typical residential installations range from $3,000 to $6,000, depending on your home's size, roofline complexity, and desired features. Commercial projects vary based on building size and requirements. We provide free, detailed quotes so you know exactly what to expect—no surprises."

**Q: What factors affect the price?**
"Several factors influence your installation cost:
- Linear feet of roofline and trim
- Number of lighting zones
- Architectural complexity (peaks, dormers, curves)
- Additional features (accent lighting, landscape integration)
- Commercial vs. residential requirements
Our free consultation includes a complete assessment and transparent pricing."

**Q: Do you offer financing?**
"Yes, we offer flexible financing options to fit your budget. Ask about our payment plans during your consultation. We believe every homeowner should have access to beautiful permanent lighting."

**Q: Is permanent lighting worth the investment?**
"Absolutely. Consider the true cost of traditional holiday lights: purchasing new strands regularly, paying for installation/removal services, or risking injury on ladders. Permanent lighting is a one-time investment that lasts for years, eliminates hassle, and adds value to your property."

### Installation FAQs

**Q: How long does installation take?**
"Most residential installations are completed in a single day, typically 4-8 hours depending on complexity. Larger homes or commercial properties may take 2-3 days. We work efficiently while ensuring meticulous attention to detail."

**Q: Will installation damage my home?**
"No. Our installation method uses specially designed mounting channels that attach securely without damaging your roofline, fascia, or trim. When properly installed by our trained technicians, there's no risk to your home's exterior."

**Q: What's the best time to install?**
"We install year-round in the Sacramento area. Many customers prefer spring or fall to avoid summer heat and have their system ready before the holidays. However, we can work in most weather conditions except heavy rain."

**Q: Do I need to be home during installation?**
"We prefer you're available at the start to review the plan and at completion to walk through operation. However, if needed, installations can proceed with proper access and a brief phone orientation afterward."

### Product FAQs

**Q: How long do the lights last?**
"Our commercial-grade LEDs are rated for 50,000+ hours of use—that's over 20 years of daily operation. Combined with our lifetime warranty, your investment is protected for the long haul."

**Q: Can I really control the lights from my phone?**
"Yes! Our mobile app gives you complete control from anywhere. Change colors, set schedules, create scenes for different occasions, and sync with holidays—all from your smartphone. Works with both iOS and Android."

**Q: What colors are available?**
"Millions. Our RGBW (Red, Green, Blue, White) LED technology can create virtually any color imaginable. From warm white for everyday elegance to vibrant colors for holidays and events, the possibilities are endless."

**Q: Are the lights visible during the day?**
"Our installation channels are designed to be subtle and unobtrusive. When the lights are off, most people don't notice them at all. The focus is on nighttime beauty without affecting your home's daytime appearance."

**Q: Can lights be individually controlled?**
"Yes, our system allows for zoned control and, in some configurations, individual light addressability. Create different effects for different areas, highlight specific architectural features, or program dynamic patterns."

### Warranty & Support FAQs

**Q: What does the lifetime warranty cover?**
"Our lifetime warranty covers the LED lights and control components against defects in materials and workmanship. If something stops working properly, we'll repair or replace it at no cost to you. Labor is included."

**Q: What happens if a light stops working?**
"Simply contact us, and we'll schedule a service visit to diagnose and resolve the issue. Under warranty, there's no charge for parts or labor. We aim to respond to service requests within 48 hours."

**Q: Do you offer maintenance services?**
"While permanent lighting requires minimal maintenance, we offer optional annual check-up services to clean channels, verify connections, and ensure optimal performance. Contact us for details."
