And when our mild winters arrive, you'll be ready to light up your home with the tap of a button, not hours of setup.

EXT Lighting proudly serves every corner of Sacramento, from the historic neighborhoods surrounding the Capitol to the master-planned communities of Natomas and beyond.

### City-Specific Introduction
"Grass Valley holds a special place in California history.

But Grass Valley isn't a museum—it's a vibrant community with a thriving arts scene, excellent restaurants, and residents who chose mountain living intentionally.

The climate here differs from the Sacramento Valley below. Grass Valley sees actual seasons, including occasional snow in winter. For homeowners, this means outdoor holiday lighting has traditionally been a challenge—cold temperatures, unpredictable weather, and the physical demands of decoration at elevation.

Permanent lighting solves these problems elegantly. Install once, control forever. When snow falls on your Victorian roofline and your lights glow warm beneath, you'll understand why Grass Valley residents are embracing this technology. EXT Lighting has experience with foothill and mountain properties, designing systems that withstand the elements while enhancing Gold Country's historic charm."
